	      are a style to define cryptographic properties and in particular to structure their proofs.
	        The CryptoZoo proof viewer allows you to engage with proofs interactively, find relevant information quickly, hide information
	        that isn't interesting to you at the moment and much more. Want to check out how it works?

		There are currently three case studies available:
		<ul>
		  <li>
			<p>
			  <a href="game-to-sim-ind-cpa-for-se.html">IND-CPA</a>: Equivalence of Semantic Security.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Simulation-based security notions for symmetric
			  encryption state that the adversary should not learn
			  more than some ideal leakage and that everything the
			  adversary can do when given a ciphertext can also be
			  done when only given the ideal leakage, but not the
			  ciphertext. While different views on ideal leakage are
			  possible, the minimal approach is to leak the length of
			  the message that is encrypted, since an adversary can
			  infer the length of the message from the length of the
			  ciphertext. Simulation-based notions which leak the
			  length of the message are typically equivalent to their
			  game-based counterparts.
			</p>
			<p>
			  In this case study, we provide a proof that
			  indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks
			  (IND-CPA) security in its Real-or-Zeroes formulation is
			  equivalent to a simulation-based formulation where the
			  simulator receives only the length of the message m. The
			  proof uses the following definitions:
			</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><a href="ind-cpa-def.html">Indistinguishability chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA)</a></li>
			  <li><a href="sim-based-ind-cpa-def.html">Simulation-based IND-CPA</a></li>
			</ul>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<p>
			  <a href="ggm.html">GGM PRF-from-PRG</a>: We give a proof for the famous <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/">GGM Tree</a> construction for <emph>constant depth</emph>.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali introduced the notion
			  of pseudo-random functions and provided a construction
			  of a pseudorandom function based on a length-doubling
			  pseudorandom generator. The proof is commonly include in
			  courses on the foundations of cryptography and
			  contained, e.g., in Chapter 3.6.2 (Theorem 3.6.6) of the
			  Foundations of Cryptography I textbook by Goldreich. The
			  construction is naturally amenable to visualization: It
			  structures PRG instances into a binary tree and the left
			  halves and right halves of a PRG output become the input
			  to the PRG instances on the next tree layer, until
			  reaching the leaf layer.
			  The proof uses the following definitions

		For a nice introduction to SSPs, Lúcás Meier wrote a <a href="https://cronokirby.com/posts/2022/05/state-separable-proofs-for-the-curious-cryptographer/">overview blogpost</a> that is highly recommended.
