	<a href="game-to-sim-ind-cpa-for-se.html">Proof</a>: Equivalence of Semantic Security.
      </p>
      <p>
	Simulation-based security notions for symmetric
	encryption state that the adversary should not learn
	more than some ideal leakage and that everything the
	adversary can do when given a ciphertext can also be
	done when only given the ideal leakage, but not the
	ciphertext. While different views on ideal leakage are
	possible, the minimal approach is to leak the length of
	the message that is encrypted, since an adversary can
	infer the length of the message from the length of the
	ciphertext. Simulation-based notions which leak the
	length of the message are typically equivalent to their
	game-based counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
	In this case study, we provide a proof that
	indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks
	(IND-CPA) security in its Real-or-Zeroes formulation is
	equivalent to a simulation-based formulation where the
	simulator receives only the length of the message m. The
	proof uses the following definitions:
